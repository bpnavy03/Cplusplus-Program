# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to integrate python and C++ into the Corner Grocer application. The C++ code called on the python code for several functions. The Python code would read a text file for grocery items, and then count the number of times an item appeared on that list, and then generate a histogram of the items and their totals. The C++ code would display a user menu and all applicable commands called upon from the python code.

#What did you do particularily well?
My integration of python and C++ is improving and I feel that I did well in this regard. Also, my in-line comments are significantly better and show improvement.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My C++ DisplayMenu name is not indicative of everything that it does. My python methods are not documented either. These aspects should be refined to make my code more efficient and secure. I would also say that my C++ code could probably do more, and could analyse for user inputs that are non-numeric.

#What pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I feel that my C++ coding is significantly better during this project and I did not struggle as much in that regard. My python coding is rusty and I should brush up on it. The hardest part for me was the python coding aspect. Some resources that I found valuable during this project were using the tutoring services, watching YouTube videos on C++/Python integration in Microsoft Visual, and the text book.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to integrate languages is fascinating and I am sure I will encounter this in the future, even if it isn't in C++ or Python. I am exciting to find other programming languages that I can integrate to increase my skills as a programmer.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My in-line comments are significantly better and allow for any developer to look at the code and realize what I have done with it. I also use whitespace well in this project, which allows for alterations as required. The code is written short, clear, and concise.
